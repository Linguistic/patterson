  越来越 (yuèláiyuè) is used frequently in Chinese to express that some quality or state is increasing with time, and
  is often translated into English as "more and more." This is the simple form of this pattern, which uses 来, but
  there is also a more complex one (which uses two different adjectives/verbs).
